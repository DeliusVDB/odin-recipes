    <h2>Chef John's Creme Caramel</h2>
    <p>
      Creme caramel belongs on the short list for 'World's Greatest Dessert.'
      The way the almost-burnt caramel layer gets fused on, and becomes one
      with, the creamy custard is nothing short of magic.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>½ cup (scant) white sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup creme fraiche</li>
      <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon orange cognac (such as Grand Marnier®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly spray 4 heatproof 6.5-oz.
          ramekins with vegetable spray. Place ramekins in a casserole dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place 1/2 cup sugar in a small, heavy, dry skillet over medium heat.
          When sugar begins to melt around the edges, gently shake the pan
          continually, swirling sugar around, until all the sugar melts; don't
          use utensils to stir. When sugar is completely melted and dark brown,
          remove the pan from heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Quickly pour equal amounts of caramel syrup into the 4 prepared
          ramekins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place 1 egg and 3 egg yolks in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup
          sugar. Whisk until sugar is dissolved and mixture becomes frothy,
          about 1 minute.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spoon the creme fraiche into the egg mixture; add the milk, vanilla,
          and Grand Marnier. Whisk together until ingredients are completely
          mixed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ladle mixture into the prepared ramekins, filling them about 2/3 to
          3/4 full.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Fill casserole with hot tap water to reach halfway up the sides of the
          ramekins. Place casserole on middle rack of preheated oven.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake until just barely set, 45 to 50 minutes. You can start checking
          for doneness at about 40 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using tongs, remove the ramekins from the casserole to a cooling rack.
          When just slightly warm, run a sharp paring knife around the edge of
          each custard.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To unmold, cover ramekin with a small plate, then invert. Chill before
          serving.
        </p>
